# Flat Folder For Tabular Files

Use `.cursor/flat/` as the default workspace drop zone for miscellaneous tabular files.

## Save Location

- When creating or exporting ad-hoc tabular files, save them in `.cursor/flat/`.
- Applies to: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.tsv`, `.psv`, `.txt` (delimited), and similar flat data extracts.

## Lookup Behavior

- If the user references a tabular file without a full/explicit path, check `.cursor/flat/` first.
- If multiple candidate files exist, present concise options and ask which one to use.

## Path Preference

- Prefer relative paths under `.cursor/flat/` in commands and examples.
- Do not scatter one-off tabular files across repo root unless the user explicitly requests another location.
