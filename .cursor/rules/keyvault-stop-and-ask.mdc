# Key Vault Stop-And-Ask Rule

When authentication depends on Key Vault or env-based secret references:

1. If the secret name or env var name is missing, ambiguous, or not explicitly provided, **stop immediately**.
2. Do **not** run API/database commands that require auth until the user provides the exact reference name.
3. Ask only for the reference name (for example `DB_SECRET_NAME`, `API_TOKEN_ENV`, `API_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME`), never for the secret value.
4. After receiving the name, state which reference name is being used, then continue.

This is a mandatory hard-stop behavior.
