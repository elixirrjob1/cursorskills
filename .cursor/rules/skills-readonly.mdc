# Skills Are Read-Only

The `.cursor/skills/` directory contains published Cursor skills. **Never modify these files.**

- Use skills when prompted (e.g. "Analyze my database", "Project storage growth").
- Do not edit, refactor, or "improve" SKILL.md, scripts, or README files under `.cursor/skills/`.
- If users want changes, they should copy skills to their own location or contribute upstream.

## Installation

When helping users install these skills, **always recommend global install**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
cp -r .cursor/skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/
```

Global install keeps skills outside the agent's workspace so the agent won't try to modify them. Per-project install is not recommended.
