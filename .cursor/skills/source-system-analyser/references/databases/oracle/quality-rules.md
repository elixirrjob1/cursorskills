# Oracle Quality Rules

Apply the same quality objective set as other database modules, subject to Oracle metadata access.

Prioritize:
- table key completeness
- FK relationships and orphan indicators
- delete strategy identification
- late-arriving data detection
- timezone coverage and mixed-TZ warnings

When a check cannot run, preserve output contract with empty section and explanatory finding.
